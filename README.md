#Current Script Version: 1.3.1
This script displays your ships shield as a percentage with a visual bar output to an ingame LCD. The script is _very_ easy to customize and configure. Included at the top of the script is a beginners guide on how to setup the script initially.

##Current Version Features: 
 * Horizontal Shield Bar 0-100% Option (_Bugged with DX11 with red background for now_) 
 * Vertical Shield Bar 0-100% Option 
 * Arched Shield Bar 0-100% Option 
 * Text Only Option 
 * Text + Text Bar Option 
 * Shield Per Second on Text Screens 
 * Multiple LCD's with the same name now display the same image 


##Known Issues: 
 * *DX11 causes Horizontal Shield background to look red*. 


##Solving Issues:
* Try reloading the Map (and|or) the game.
* Is your timer block running? They seem to stop after power downs with the latest patch.
* Is your timer running the program and then starting itself?
* Is your shield generator named "Shield:"
* Are you using the latest version of the script? Be sure to check back every so often for newer versions and load them into the game.
* If your shield is stuck at 99%, this is due to a reporting error from the Energy Shield's mod. The current workaround is to damage your shield a bit and it will recharge to full.
