## Solving Issues:
* Make sure your LCD is named in the correct format. Examples [Shield LCD:THYA-C] or [Shield LCD:BTS]
* Edit the script then save and re-run it.
* Are you using the latest version of the script? Be sure to check back every so often for newer versions and load them into the game.
* Delete the script in the programming block and reload the stock script.
* Load a new world with only the shield and graphics mods. Some other mods may conflict with the script.
* If you are using the "Shield with better hit sounds" version you may encounter a "Named Block Not Shield Generator" error in the programming block. We are currently looking into this issue. For now, I suggest you do not use it.
* If you are a server operator DO NOT subscribe the server to this script. It will cause numerous issues. Each user must subscribe to this script individually.
